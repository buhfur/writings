title: Topics To Learn 
---

There are some interesting topics that I believe I may be personally motivated to learn and explore.
So far i've been filling my head with computer networking nonsense that I won't ever apply to my day job 80% of the time.

And maybe that's my problem and why I have almost completely burnt out on programming. Because i'm almost never
working on something that I **want** to work on. I have only been working on projects that I think will give me and edge
when finding another job. However , I should remember that it doesn't matter what the project is or what I write 
the project in ; As a programming language does **not** define a programmer. A programmer, I would say , is an 
individual that simply likes to write code. How a programmer does it , and how much a programmer does it , is irrelevant. And this only exists to re-enforce negative sterotypes with the field. 

To clarify

I'm an amateur programmer with my only experience being my hobby projects I started to work on after picking up a
very simple language ( python 3.4 at the time ). And even now , currently working at a helpdesk, i'm still not 100%
sure I even **want** a programming job. But it is all I think about these days ( besides world of warcraft and my partner) .

So I think I should move on from the silly questions of " is this useful? ", and " Will this teach me anything new? ". 

I believe that it's time to move on from trying to fit the unrealistic expectations of being a "useful" programmer

Cause there are enough people in this world who are functionally useful, we need some who just like to have fun with it.

And by "it" I mean your hobby projects, not your daily work, that's boring.

Now let's get into which topics i'm mainly talking about, these are what I believe I would have a blast working on 

Topics( unorganized ) :
---
- frontend design
- tools for game development ( this could be its own wider topic )
- terrain generation 
- RPG tools for making new spells, etc. 
- 3d modeling tools 
- building generation for 3d simulations 
- ingame map generators 
- find nearby stores, make a grocery list through their online portal 
create a grocery list with certain dietary filters ( like vegan ) 

- gym routine generator 
- app to pull up guides for the game you are currently playing , IN the game you are playing 
( floating window wizardry )

- game server for multiplayer games
