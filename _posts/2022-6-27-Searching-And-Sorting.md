Introduction
---
This topic is by far the most commonly taught concept in computer science. I would like 
to learn about this giant subject ( surface level knowledge for the moment ) 

and understand the thought process that has went into solving very complex problems with a 
written set of instructions.

Some of these may not be widely used, but might be helpful to understand their faults in order to not 
repeat history and waste time on a solution that has already been proved as unhelpful.
