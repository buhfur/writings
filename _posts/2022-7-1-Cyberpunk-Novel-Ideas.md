Summary
---
Imagine a story revolving around a man who sits in a dim cubicle, reliving his highest and lowest 
moments in life. Reflecting on all his triumphs and mistakes. There is no action in this story. Just 
a very uncomfortable reality that some of us may face later in our working lives. The feelings 
of loneliness and mild depression can weigh on us all and affect our daily flow. At first our character
who I will call "moe" is working for some unknown company. There are no indications of what he does 
or who he works for. The entire idea behind this story is the idea of bleakness , in an otherwise exciting world. 
We are all tempted by the dream of sucess or fame & fortune. However, there aren't many stories that DON'T show 
the outcome of our protagonist. 

> Note: I'm sure that this could be tweaked to fit many settings , but I decided the bleak 
dystopian future theme fit the jist of this story. But here's a flow chart of how the story would go 

> Note: I'm inspired by a recent song by the band "Basement" and their beautiful song "Stigmata". After reading 
the description for the band on spotify. I would like to credit my inspiration by quoting this beautifully souless 
saying taken from an interview about the song; "*What if there is not light at the end of the tunnel? What if it's just darkness?"
