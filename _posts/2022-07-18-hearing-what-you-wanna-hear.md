I would like to dedicate my writing about this topic to my inner thoughts, and the love of my life 
Natalie Susan Severeid.


Power
---

"*fighting fire with fire*"

This quote has been used plenty of times to describe an irrational personal irrational motion, to make a change
against a greater power.

Coming from a higher position of privelledge, I don't know whether it is my authority to speak on such a subject
but rather than avoid it. I must reveal what I believe about people in positions of **power** .

I don't know why i'm writing this, and this draft will be very skewed, but I feel it is my right on this green
earth to write about what I care about and how I deal with certain situations in my life. Anywho onto the topic 
at hand. Let me describe to you what I have been through lately, and what this has led me to believe about people
in power


Summary
---
- moved into housing on the august of 2019 and have been living there on and off 
- have had trouble with the staff there, here is a list of my problems with student housing. 
  - prices are too high 
  - buildings are old and unmaintained.
  - when I returned to my room in L after living in building M for the summer, the room was filthy
  and still had items in the drawers which I had left which were supposed to be thrown away. 
  - when moving into building M , I was treated like shit by jackson russel, who just made snarky 
  remarks and insulted me for filling out the wrong paper for the move in registration. 
  - there are signifigant differences between the buildings after I ( since the buildings are labeled , A-M )
  - buildings J-M are signifigantly better than the buildings before , which have stained floors 
  gross ceilings , and just horrid smells. Not to mention the mold problem in some of the buildings. 
  - housing changes the times to pickup your mail, starting out very reasonble, only to degrade over time 
  by limiting the times someone can even walk into the building to pick up their mail.
